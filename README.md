# Yelp Camp
Web-based platform that allows users find available campgrounds anywhere in the world.

Users can create, edit and delete their own campgrounds.

Users can display the name, location, description, price per night and the pictures of their campgrounds.

Users can see review of the campgrounds from other users, and rate and write a review on their own.
